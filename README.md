# Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure the following are installed:
- Bun (v1.0 or higher, available at [bun.sh](https://bun.sh))
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, or Edge)

# Installation
To set up the Canva Clone Project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DoctorDictator/Canva.git
   cd Canva
   ```

2. Install Dependencies:
   Use Bun to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Start the Development Server:
   Launch the application in development mode using Vite with Bun:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access the application.

4. Build for Production:
   Generate a production-ready build:
   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```
   The optimized output will be located in the `dist` directory.

# Usage
# Accessing the Editor
- Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) after starting the development server.
- Select a new design or choose from available templates.

# Creating Designs
- Use the toolbar to add images, text, or shapes.
- Customize elements with styling and alignment tools.

# Exporting Designs
- Save your work or export designs in your preferred format via the export menu.
